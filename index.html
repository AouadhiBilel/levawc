        <h2>Welcome to the LevAWC Project on GitHub</h2>
	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>Good progamming tools are crucial for efficient software development. One specific tool in the programmers toolbox, is an API for containers, so you can fiddle, search and sort data in memory - according to your liking. If your are working on a big project, this is no big deal, since there are lots of resources for this out there - on the Net (STL, GLib,...). However, if it's a small project, if you are a student - or just interested in the inner workings of the Data Structures, that comprise this kind of tool - it might be a little trickier to find a quick solution. If memory resources are scarce in the environment where your software is supposed to run, you might need another solution. This is where 'LevAWC' might come in handy. 'LevAWC' contains some fundamental containers for programming, written in ANSI C. Moreover, they are generic, compact, fairly well-documented - and fast.</p>
	<p>The original source code for 'LevAWC' is written by <a href="http://www.kyleloudon.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Loudon</a>, in his book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565924536.do" target="_blank">Mastering Algorithms with C</a> - published at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly Company</a>. I have rewritten and extended some minor parts of the original source code - and consider myself just a maintainer of Kyle's work.
	<p>Finally, I want to thank <a href="http://www.kyleloudon.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Loudon</a> and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/36" target="_blank">Andy Oram</a> at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a> for giving me permisson to publish this code at GitHub.</p>

	</p>

	<h3>Documentation</h3>
	<p>The project documentation is available by clicking on the 'Documentation' button in menu on the left - or <a href="./documentation/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. You might want to look at the <a href="./documentation/md__change_log.html" target="_blank">ChangeLog</a>, for example.</p>
	<p>You can even reproduce the Documentation, locally, on your box. Clone - or download zip/tar.gz file of this project - install <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/" target="_blank">Doxygen</a> - and finally run command:<pre> <code>$ doxygen</code> </pre> - from the command prompt - when standing in the top-most directory of your clone. Then point your browser to the file <code>index.html</code> in the the new subdirectory  <code>html</code> - recently created by this command.</p>

	<h3>Download</h3>
	<p>In case you want a copy of the complete repository - just use one of the 2 upper buttons on the left - depending of the compression format you prefer. The simplest way to build all sources to binary code might be to use the built-in makefiles, present in the '<code>demos</code>' subdirectory. Usage:</p>

	  <pre>$ make -f linux.mak                 // On Linux, Unix, Windows/MSYS...
$ mingw32-make -f mingw32.mak       // On Windows/MinGW...
$ nmake -f vcwin32.mak              // On Windows/MSVC...</pre>
	<p>After this, the demo programs and the library are built-and-ready in this '<code>demos</code>' subdirectory. To clean the subdirectory - just run the same command again - with option '<code>clean</code>' added - at the end of the command. </p>
	<p>Another possibility - if you are sitting on a UNIX/Linux box (or Cygwin, MSYS/MinGW on Win32) - is to download a GNU Tarball, so you can do a quick:

<pre>$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install                  // If - you want to install...</pre>

 - to get it all set. This might even work on a Mac, although I've not verfied this, so far. I've tested the GNU Tarball on Linux and MSYS/MingGW - with good results, though.</p>
	<p>Still another possibility is, of course, your own building strategy set up by yourself - on your own system. This might be the best solution in some cases.</p>

	<p>Just click the 'View on GitHub' button - on the left.</p>

	<h3>Enjoy!</h3>

	<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

	<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
	    $ git fetch origin
	    $ git checkout gh-pages
	</code></pre>

	<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

	<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

	<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

	<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

	<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

	<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

	<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

	<h3>Support or Contact</h3>

	<p>Having trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at <a href="http://help.github.com/pages">http://help.github.com/pages</a> or contact <a href="mailto:support@github.com">support@github.com</a> and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.</p>
